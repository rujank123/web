<p>At Rk Travels & Tours, our aim is to provide a platform for cultural awareness and heritage preservation in the Himalayas through the promotion of responsible tourism. Our late founder, Das Shrestha, incorporated this vision into the base of how we operate. We believe that there is more to an object, or an experience, than simply the material; we believe that humanity exists and expresses itself in myriad unique ways, which has an intrinsic worth that speaks beyond words. This is art, this is culture, this is magic. At Rk Travels & Tours, we believe in preserving and sharing this magic.
<br><br>
In 1969, Rk Travels & Tours was one of the first travel agencies to be established in Nepal, at a time when the country had just started opening its doors to visitors.  From humble beginnings, our team worked hard to bring the company to the forefront of the industry. We are proud that today our services are among the most professional, service-oriented and efficient found in Nepal today. At Rk Travels & Tours, we believe in the value of people and the value of an experience; providing good people with memories that will last a lifetime is our way of making this world a little wiser, a little kinder and a little bit smaller.

As your experienced partner in Nepal, we invite you to an unforgettable journey. Let us make your dreams come true.

 <br>
<br>
